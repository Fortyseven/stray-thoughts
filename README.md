# Workflow

- Get topic
- Generate monologue
- Generate prompt from monologue
- Generate audio from monologue
- Create generated video backdrop from prompt using audio length as guideline (full length, or just loop short clip?)
- Generate subtitles with timecodes (whisper)

- Merge together:
  - generated video
  - generated audio
  - overlay subtitles using time codes
  - public domain music? (later, generated)
